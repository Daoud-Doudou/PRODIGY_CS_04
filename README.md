# Keylogger Script

## Description

This Python script is a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes and logs them to a file. It uses the `pynput` library to listen for key press events and writes these events to a file named `key_log.txt`. This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
